## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
In this project, we will dive into the Figure-8(now Appen) disaster response message which is available on Appen[Disaster Response dataset](https://appen.com/datasets/combined-disaster-response-data/)). We will implement ETL(Extract, Transform and Load) pipeline, ML pipeline and dash based web application which will show a data dashboard for visualization and also a text classification which will take input from user and give probabilites of different labels.
